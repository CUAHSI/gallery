        <h2> Description </h2>
        <p>This resource serves as a template for creating a curve number grid raster file which could be used to create corresponding maps or for further utilization, soil data and reclassified land-use raster files are created along the process, user has to provided or connect to a set of shape-files including boundary of watershed, soil data and land-use containing this watershed, land-use reclassification and curve number look up table. Script contained in this resource mainly uses PyQGIS through Jupyter Notebook for majority of the processing with a touch of Pandas for data manipulation. Detailed description of procedure are commented in the script.</p>
