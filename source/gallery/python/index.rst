    **Description**
     This resource serves as a template for creating a curve number grid raster file which could be used to create
     corresponding maps or for further utilization, soil data and reclassified land-use raster files are created along
     the process, user has to provided or connect to a set of shape-files including boundary of watershed, soil data
     and land-use containing this watershed, land-use reclassification and curve number look up table. Script contained
     in this resource mainly uses PyQGIS through Jupyter Notebook for majority of the processing with a touch of Pandas
     for data manipulation. Detailed description of procedure are commented in the script.
