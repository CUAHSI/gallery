    <h2> Description </h2>

    
    
    <p>Script and accompanying ipython notebook written in Python 2.7 for aggregating sub-daily environmental data (rainfall, tide, wind, groundwater) to a daily timescale. The input data are from Norfolk, Virginia. Several different methods of aggregation are used including averages and maximums.  The processed/aggregated data are combined with street flood report data to be used in data-driven, predictive modeling. The script in this resource was used in the analysis described in this Journal of Hydrology paper: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2018.01.044.</p>
