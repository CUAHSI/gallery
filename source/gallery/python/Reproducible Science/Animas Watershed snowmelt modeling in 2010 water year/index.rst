        <h2> Description </h2>
        <p>This resource contains the use case results of web-based simulation for snowmelt modeling research. The model input files were created by executing the Python script (ueb_setup.py) in CUAHSI JupyterHub web app, which made web requests to HydroDS modeling web services (https://github.com/CI-WATER/Hydro-DS) for inputs preparation. The model output files were created by using the model input files and the UEB web app (https://appsdev.hydroshare.org/apps/ueb-app/). A JupyterHub Notebook file (Data_analysis_code.ipynb) includes the data analysis code to compare the model output created by this use case and another use case (https://doi.org/10.4211/hs.1be4d7902c87481d85b93daad99cf471) with different model grid resolutions (600 m vs 1200 m).</p>
