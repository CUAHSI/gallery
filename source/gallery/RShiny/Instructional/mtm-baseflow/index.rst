                This application shows how mountaintop mining in Central Appalachia has changed the hydrology and water chemistry of two catchments that have been heavily mined. The study follows a paired watershed approach, where we have two reference catchment that are unmined paired with two catchments that have been mined. The small catchments (~1km2) are Rich's Branch (reference) and Laurel Branch (99% mined), while the large ones (35 km2) are Left Fork (reference) and Mud River. To interact with the app click on a catchment and then select tabs.
