    <h2> Description </h2>

    
    
    <p>Physical Properties of Rivers: Querying Metadata and Discharge Data<br><br>This lesson was adapted from educational material written by Dr. Kateri Salk for her Fall 2019 Hydrologic Data Analysis course at Duke University. This is the second part of a two-part exercise focusing on the physical properties of rivers. <br><br>Introduction<br><br>Rivers are bodies of freshwater flowing from higher elevations to lower elevations due to the force of gravity. One of the most important physical characteristics of a stream or river is discharge, the volume of water moving through the river or stream over a given amount of time. Discharge can be measured directly by measuring the velocity of flow in several spots in a stream and multiplying the flow velocity over the cross-sectional area of the stream. However, this method is effort-intensive. This exercise will demonstrate how to approximate discharge by developing a rating curve for a stream at a given sampling point. You will also learn to query metadata from and compare discharge patterns in climatically different regions of the United States. <br><br> Learning Objectives <br><br>After successfully completing this exercise, you will be able to:<br><br>1. Execute queries to pull a variety of National Water Information System (NWIS) and Water Quality Portal (WQP) data into R.<br>2. Analyze seasonal and interannual characteristics of stream discharge and compare discharge patterns in different regions of the United States</p>
