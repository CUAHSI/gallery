        <h2> Description </h2>
        <p>High Frequency Flow Data: Introduction to Dygraphs<br><br>This lesson was adapted from educational material written by Dr. Kateri Salk and teaching assistant Cathy Chamberlin for her Fall 2019 Hydrologic Data Analysis course at Duke University. This is the first part of a two-part exercise focusing on high frequency flow data. <br><br>Introduction<br><br>High frequency data is usually defined as frequencies significantly lower than daily (e.g. 5-minute, 15-minute, 1 hr etc). The large amount of data allows us to distinguish between different models (model validation) with a higher statistical precision. Baseflow is a portion of streamflow that is not directly generated from the excess rainfall during a storm event. In other words, this is the flow that would exist in the stream without the contribution of direct runoff from the rainfall. It should not be confused with groundwater flow. Quickflow is the part of a storm rainfall which moves quickly to a stream channel via surface runoff or overland flow, and forms a flood wave in the channel.  What types of hydrological and biological processes happen on this timescale that we might want to investigate?<br><br>Learning Objectives<br><br>After successfully completing this notebook, you will be able to:<br>1. Determine stormflow and baseflow from high frequency flow data<br>2. Communicate findings with peers through oral, visual, and written modes</p>
