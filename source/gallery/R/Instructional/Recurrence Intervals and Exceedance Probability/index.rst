    <h2> Description </h2>

    
    
    <p>Physical Properties of Rivers: Calculating Recurrence Interval and Exceedance Probability<br><br>This lesson was adapted from educational material written by Dr. Kateri Salk for her Fall 2019 Hydrologic Data Analysis course at Duke University. This is the first part of a two-part exercise focusing on the physical properties of rivers. <br><br>Introduction<br><br>Rivers are bodies of freshwater flowing from higher elevations to lower elevations due to the force of gravity. One of the most important physical characteristics of a stream or river is discharge, the volume of water moving through the river or stream over a given amount of time. This exercise will introduce the concepts of Recurrence Intervals and Exceedance Probability for the prediction of streamflow discharge. <br><br> Learning Objectives <br><br>After successfully completing this exercise, you will be able to:<br><br>1. Execute queries to pull a variety of National Water Information System (NWIS) and Water Quality Portal (WQP) data into R.<br>2. Calculate recurrence interval and exceedance probability from daily discharge data.</p>
