# Exploratory Data Analysis for the Physical Properties of Lakes

This lesson was adapted from educational material written by Dr. Kateri Salk for her Fall 2019 Hydrologic Data Analysis course at Duke University. This is the first part of a two-part exercise focusing on the physical properties of lakes. 

## Introduction

Lakes are dynamic, nonuniform bodies of water in which the physical, biological, and chemical properties interact. Lakes also contain the majority of Earth's fresh water supply. This lesson introduces exploratory data analysis in the context of the physical properties of lakes. 

## Learning Objectives

After successfully completing this exercise, you will be able to:

1. Apply exploratory data analytics skills to applied questions about physical properties of lakes

## Requirements to Complete Lesson 

### Packages

This lesson requires the installation of the following R packages to run the provided script:

- `tidyverse`- Version 1.3.0. A collection of R packages designed for data science.

- `lubridate`- Version 1.7.9. Functions for working with dates/times.

### Data and Code

The input files are made available to you in a public folder. 

This lesson also requires the dataset NTER-LTER_Lake_ChemistryPhysics_Raw.csv. 

The dataset used in this lesson contains data from studies on several lakes in the North Temperate Lakes District in the state of Wisconsin. The data were collected as part of the Long Term Ecological Research station created by the National Science Foundation.  More information can be found here:
