## 1. Executive Summary

The rate of advancement in the field of hydroinformatics, specifically advancements in cyberinfrastructure capabilities and associated software libraries, requires scientists to continuously explore and evaluate new tools and approaches for working with water science data and models. While documentation for most of these tools is readily available in their respective software repositories, e.g. GitHub, we often rely on our professional network and published literature to stay informed regarding best practices and new approaches. There have been efforts in neighboring communities ([CyberGISX](https://cybergis.illinois.edu/notebooks/), [Pangeo](https://gallery.pangeo.io/)) and individual software projects (e.g. [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/2.0.2/gallery.html), [Python Graph Gallery](https://www.python-graph-gallery.com/)), to consolidate examples, tutorials, and best practices, however the water science community lacks a central location to collate hydrology-specific code examples. As an NSF facility CUAHSI tasked with fostering reserch and education in the water science community via shared scientific infrastructure, and is well positioned to lead an initiative to construct (and maintain/host) a web interface for integrating such community gallery efforts while also engaging the water science community to establish a self-currated library of scientific code examples that execute in CUAHSI and partner computing environments.

The CUAHSI Gallery is a web interface that provides customizable landing pages for scientific coding examples, research workflows, and educational material that are stored in community repositories such as HydroShare. By grouping and organizing gallery content based on application, theme, and/or programming language, it enables scientists to easily share and disseminate code. Current efforts are aimed at (1) providing web readable and executable code in the form of Jupyter Notebooks and MATLAB Livescripts, as well as landing pages for web applications that CUAHSI hosts on behalf of the community. The primary objectives are to:

  - Establish a web interface for all of CUAHSI’s compute and modeling activities. The gallery helps us accomplish this by providing a portal that links code and modeling workflows with our compute, modeling, and data repositories. 
  - Provide a centralized collection of code and modeling workflows that exist within (and outside of) HydroShare, organized in a manner that makes them easy to navigate for instructional and research applications.
  - Create web landing pages for all CUAHSI-hosted web applications.

### 1.1 Inspiration

- matplotlib gallery
- pangeo gallery
- cybergisX

### 1.2 Alignment with CUAHSI Services

- Hydroshare: discovery for high quality code
- Virtiual University code modules
- App hosting landing pages
- Advertisement for cloud computing services; JH, MO, etc.

### 1.3 Alignment with CUAHSI’s strategic objectives.

This work contributes to the following strategic objectives ([CUAHSI Strategic Plan](https://www.cuahsi.org/uploads/pages/img/StrategicPlan_SinglePages.pdf):

**Goal 1: Promote discovery in the water sciences through leadership in water data services in support of interdisciplinary collaborative research.**
  - Provide avenues for enhanced community modeling, including data services to support modeling and collaborations on modeling governance.
  - Ensure that CUAHSI Water Data Services support the complete life cycle of data management from collection, quality control and analysis, to archival, publication, discovery, and reuse.

This project will establish a public gallery of water science code and modeling workflows that directly address the objectives above by: (1) providing a portal for community researchers and instructors to share workflows that leverage CUAHSI’s data repositories and other software tools, (2) provide a pattern for advertising reproducible scientific workflows that have been published in HydroShare and can be executing in CUAHSI’s compute cloud.

**Goal 2: Foster and facilitate the integration of hydrologic science research and data services into innovative, multi-disciplinary educational and community building activities**
  - Increase engagement with academic partners through remote or on-site seminars to promote CUAHSI water data and community services.

This project will increase engagement between CUAHSI and our academic partners as well as facilitate engagement between educators and researchers at various academic institutions by providing a platform to host community scientific and educational workflows. The contents of the gallery will leverage CUAHSI technologies whenever possible to demonstrate the benefits of using our tools. Moreover, gallery contents can be used to host and/or archive materials from community services events such as webinars, virtual university, and workshops.

**Goal 3: Grow and diversify CUAHSI partners and funding sources to ensure sustainability of services through a multi-disciplinary approach**
   - Educate the broad water community (Federal and State agencies, volunteer monitoring organizations, water utilities, and non-profits) about CUAHSI’s services and seek ways to support their needs.

A goal of this project is to establish a platform that will enable code sharing and discovery across interdisciplinary topics. This aligns with CUAHSI’s strategic objective of educating a broad community about software and community services by curating a collection of workflows that leverage (and demonstrate the use of) CUAHSI’s data repositories and cloud computing platforms.

**Goal 4: Increase the visibility, reach, and reputation of CUAHSI in the diverse water community.**
  - Increase direct engagement of CUAHSI staff with the user community through seminars, workshops, conferences, etc. to increase visibility and to provide training.

The outcome of this project will connect the scientists with CUAHSI staff and community activities by providing a platform to publicly host material from seminars, workshops, conference presentations, teaching events, and research projects. This platform can be leveraged throughout CUAHSI’s community events as a central location for archiving and sharing content that leverages past CUAHSI investments in data and computational software.

## Functional Description

This section outlines to primary functions and components of the CUAHSI Gallery.

### Gallery Interface

The gallery interface encompasses all of the web pages and categories that are displayed on webpage. Example content should be grouped into categories for easy searching and discovery. Most importantly, the core gallery code shouldn't require manual intervention (e.g. compiling and re-deploying) to include additional community-contributed examples. The key components of this interface are listed below:

  - Support both high-level categories (e.g. programming language) as well as theme/topic-based categories (e.g. educational, national water model, etc.). 
  - Mechanism for community scientists to easily contribute examples that are stored in repositories such as HydroShare.
