## Project Opportunity/ Description/ Summarized Business Case:

The purpose of the CUAHSI Compute Gallery is threefold:

- The first element is to establish a web presence (i.e. homepage) for all of CUAHSI’s compute and modeling activities. The gallery helps us accomplish this by providing a portal that links code and modeling workflows with our compute, modeling, and data repositories. 
- The second element is to provide a centralized collection of code and modeling workflows that exist within (and outside of) HydroShare, organized in a manner that makes them easy to navigate for instructional and continuing educational applications. 
- The third element is to establish a public web platform for our community members to collaborate around instructional and reproducible content. 


## Alignment with CUAHSI’s strategic objectives?

This work contributes to the following strategic objectives:

- Goal 1: Promote discovery in the water sciences through leadership in water data services in support of interdisciplinary collaborative research.
  - Provide avenues for enhanced community modeling, including data services to support modeling and collaborations on modeling governance.
  - Ensure that CUAHSI Water Data Services support the complete life cycle of data management from collection, quality control and analysis, to archival, publication, discovery, and reuse.

This project will establish a public gallery of water science code and modeling workflows that directly address the objectives above by: (1) providing a portal for community researchers and instructors to share workflows that leverage CUAHSI’s data repositories and other software tools, (2) provide a pattern for advertising reproducible scientific workflows that have been published in HydroShare and can be executing in CUAHSI’s compute cloud.

- Goal 2: Foster and facilitate the integration of hydrologic science research and data services into innovative, multi-disciplinary educational and community building activities
  - Increase engagement with academic partners through remote or on-site seminars to promote CUAHSI water data and community services.

This project will increase engagement between CUAHSI and our academic partners as well as facilitate engagement between educators and researchers at various academic institutions by providing a platform to host community scientific and educational workflows. The contents of the gallery will leverage CUAHSI technologies whenever possible to demonstrate the benefits of using our tools. Moreover, gallery contents can be used to host and/or archive materials from community services events such as webinars, virtual university, and workshops.

- Goal 3: Grow and diversify CUAHSI partners and funding sources to ensure sustainability of services through a multi-disciplinary approach
   - Educate the broad water community (Federal and State agencies, volunteer monitoring organizations, water utilities, and non-profits) about CUAHSI’s services and seek ways to support their needs.

A goal of this project is to establish a platform that will enable code sharing and discovery across interdisciplinary topics. This aligns with CUAHSI’s strategic objective of educating a broad community about software and community services by curating a collection of workflows that leverage (and demonstrate the use of) CUAHSI’s data repositories and cloud computing platforms.

- Goal 4: Increase the visibility, reach, and reputation of CUAHSI in the diverse water community. 
  - Increase direct engagement of CUAHSI staff with the user community through seminars, workshops, conferences, etc. to increase visibility and to provide training.

The outcome of this project will connect the scientists with CUAHSI staff and community activities by providing a platform to publicly host material from seminars, workshops, conference presentations, teaching events, and research projects. This platform can be leveraged throughout CUAHSI’s community events as a central location for archiving and sharing content that leverages past CUAHSI investments in data and computational software.
